## Development

See the [kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions setting up your development environment. Once you have completed that, use the following npm tasks.

  - `npm start`

    Start kibana and have it include this plugin

  - `npm start -- --config kibana.yml`

    You can pass any argument that you would normally send to `bin/kibana` by putting them after `--` when running `npm start`

  - `npm run build`

    Build a distributable archive

For more information about any of these commands run `npm run ${task} -- --help`.
